# hanberryfinalexpresso
This is a full stack Java app that documents ingredients for coffee drinks and tracks allergens in baked good items.

This is a maven project that uses Spring boot, AngularJS (using ui-router), and PostgreSQL.  
To initiate database, create new postgres database named finalproject. 



To run integration tests, please create a second database with the name finalprojecttest.
This will create an identical schema and test against that so that you don't contaminate your existing data
